To run compile the scheduler using "gcc main.c linkedlist.c". Then use "gcc prime_calc.c -oprime_calc.o" to compile the prime number calculator program. Run using "./a.out". Input the desired file name when prompted. The provided file is called "input.txt". The output file is named "gantt.txt". 

If you want to view the queue linkedlist while the program is running, uncomment the "printList()" call at the end of the "handleProcess()" function in the "main.c" file. This gives you a detailed read of the queue linkedlist while the program runs.
